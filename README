This is a pile of scripts for working with Riichi mahjong stuff and Tenhou logs. APIs are currently not stable. Sorted
roughly in order of usefulness:

tenhou.py: Currently capable of stepping through tenhou .mjlog files (mostly), as well as a bunch of other currently
incomplete mahjong-related features

urldecode.py: Convert a replay URL to an mjlog URL.

calcquiz.html: JS-based score drilling tool (just fu/han -> points calculations)

tenhou_gui.py: Sort of working replay viewer. Uses the Kivy library to render.

extract_hands.py: Used for generating my wait quiz (http://waitquiz.nfshost.com). Steps through logs and spits out a
representation of the game state at the point when someone wins.

gamestate.py: Builds the pages for the wait quiz. Messy HTML table representation of a table state. Works on the output
of extract_hands.py.

test.py: Basic verification tests (not proper unit tests)
test_agari.py: Tests for the agari functions (python unittests)
test_yaku.py: Tests for the yaku checking functions (python unittests)

paifu.py: Will at some point generate a single-page visual log of a hand.

score_quiz.py: Will at some point replace umaikelly's scoring quiz.
